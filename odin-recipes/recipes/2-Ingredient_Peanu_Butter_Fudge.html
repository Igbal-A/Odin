    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This two-ingredient peanut butter fudge is the easiest fudge ever, and it is so <br>
         good. Every time I make it, I get so many compliments on how great it is. I hope <br>
          you try it and enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound white confectioners' coating (white almond bark), broken up</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter (such as Jif)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with plastic wrap long enough to overhang the dish <br>
        by several inches on each side.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Place broken confectioners' coating in a large glass microwave-safe bowl. <br>
        Microwave on Low power until melted, smooth, and creamy, about 5 minutes, <br>
         stirring every 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in peanut butter until fudge is <br>
         thoroughly combined. Spread into the prepared baking dish.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Refrigerate fudge until set, 1 to 2 hours. Lift out of the pan using the overhanging <br>
         plastic wrap as handles; slice into 48 squares with a pizza cutter.</p>
