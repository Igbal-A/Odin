    <h1>Witches' Hats</h1>
    <img src="../img/witches_hats.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Witches' hats are cute and simple Halloween treats that everyone will love. <br>
    The amount this recipe makes depends on how many cookies and chocolate kisses you have. <br>
    It just depends on how many you want. The last time I made these, I ended up making about 140 or so.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages fudge stripe cookies</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup honey, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (9 ounce) bag milk chocolate candy kisses, unwrapped</li>
        <li>1 (4.5 ounce) tube decorating gel</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Place a fudge stripe cookie with bottom side up onto a work surface. <br> 
    Smear a small dab (about 1/8 teaspoon) of honey onto the bottom of a chocolate kiss, <br>
    and secure the candy piece to the center of the cookie, covering the hole.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Use decorating gel to pipe a small bow onto the cookie at the base of the candy <br>
        piece. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</p>
