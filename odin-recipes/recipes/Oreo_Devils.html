    <h1>Oreo® Devils</h1>
    <img src="../img/Oreo_Devils.jpeg" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I made these little chocolate-covered Oreo® devils with my kids yesterday and <br>
        they were a huge hit! I did the covering and they did the decorating. We also did <br>
        a second batch as little monsters, where we just dunked the tops into red <br>
        sprinkles and then glued either 1 big eye or lots of little eyes onto them. They <br>
        were gone in no time at the kids' school Halloween party.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces red fondant</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package red confectioner's coating (such as Wilton® Candy Melts®)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)</li>
        <li>72 small candy eyeballs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Shape red fondant into 72 little horns relative to the size of the cookies. Line 2 <br>
        baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Place red confectioner's coating in the top of a double boiler over simmering <br>
        water. Stir constantly, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid <br>
        scorching, until melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Use a spoon to cover the top and sides of each cookie with melted red coating. <br>
         Place on the prepared baking sheet. Stick 2 small devil horns near the top and <br>
          add 2 candy eyeballs. Let stand until dry, about 1 hour.</p>
